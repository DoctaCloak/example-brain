System conceived by Tiago Forte

# Projects
- Short term collection of tasks and notes
- Collecting information in the folder
- Example: Create a Web API in Go for fetching weather

# Areas
- Something you're responsible for over a longer period of time
- Ongoing engagement or responsibility
- Example: House 
	- Responsible for maintenance
	- Making sure the roof doesn't leak
	- Regular painting
- Example: Large scale application
	- Package updates
	- maintenance
	- user feature requests

# Resources
- Collections of information which you expect to be useful in the future
- Reference, things you expect to come back to
- Go, Golang, Linux, Gardening, Homesteading, Holiday Resources (Hiking)

# Archive
- Notes which are not useful currently or in the near future, but which you don't want to throw away either
- This is useful because you mostly navigate your archive through search and maybe you forgot a thought or a note and suddenly it is resurfaced.
- You can exclude your archive from your search as well if you don't want that thought.
